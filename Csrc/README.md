# Introduction

Here is the source code of Advanced Encryption System (AES), wriiten in C code.

`AES.h`
The header file, including all the function declarations. But the detailed functions and comments are not in this file.

`AES.c`
The function implementations of AES with 128 bits key size (that's why I call it simple).

`test.c`
The test case applying the previous functions. The test case is from ***Cryptography Thoery and Practice (3rd edtion)**, Douglas R. Stinson*, Chapter 3, Exercise 3.5 & 3.6
